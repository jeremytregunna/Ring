# Ring

Building a streaming application? Audio? Video? You'll want a circular buffer of some sort to hold your frames. This library provides one option that you can use in your iOS Swift projects.

This library is intended to be generic, memory and thread safe. Please report any bugs you find.

## Installing

Simply build this framework, and copy the resulting Ring.framework into your project. This repository is not updated a lot, because there is no need. The API is stable.
